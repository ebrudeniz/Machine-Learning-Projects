# 🤖 Machine Learning Portfolio

Hello! 👋

This repository is my personal portfolio where I document my journey in data science and machine learning, and showcase the projects I have completed.

Here, you will find projects where I have worked with various datasets, applied different algorithms, and derived data-driven insights. My goal is to continuously improve my skills in this field and present what I have learned through concrete examples.
